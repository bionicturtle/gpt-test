My one shot prompt is lazy (aka, lazy one shot):

`write an r code function that reads a text file and grabs all of the sentences that contain verbs which are in a defined vector`

```{r echo=TRUE, include = TRUE}
# Required package: stringr
# Install package if not already installed: install.packages("stringr")
library(tidyverse)

# Function to extract sentences containing verbs from a text file
extractSentencesWithVerbs <- function(file_path, verb_vector) {
  # Read the text file
  text <- readLines(file_path)
  
  # Initialize an empty list to store sentences with verbs
  sentences_with_verbs <- list()
  
  # Iterate over each line in the text
  for (line in text) {
    # Split the line into sentences using regex
    sentences <- str_split(line, "\\.|\\?|\\!")
    
    # Iterate over each sentence. David: loops are inelegant but it works
    for (sentence in sentences[[1]]) {
      # Check if the sentence contains any verbs from the verb vector
      if (any(str_detect(sentence, paste(verb_vector, collapse = "|")))) {
        # Add the sentence to the list
        sentences_with_verbs <- c(sentences_with_verbs, sentence)
      }
    }
  }
  
  # Return the list of sentences with verbs
  return(sentences_with_verbs)
}

# Example usage
# Define the file path and verb vector
file_path <- "https://gist.github.com/bionicturtle/eb3f2f83ee4d7e98f79ca02e4c50eb8d"
# verb_vector <- c("calculate", "compute")
verb_vector <- c("calculate", "calculating", "compute", "apply", "estimate")

# Call the function
result <- extractSentencesWithVerbs(file_path, verb_vector)

# Print the extracted sentences
str(result)
print(result)

# The two line below are the only code I (David Harper) added. WTH. I should note
# that it's maybe not the BEST way to learn R because the loop is arguably
# bad form but whatever ... I didn't need to lookup the regex and
# even better: I can ask GPT to interpret the regex for me

result_v <- as_vector(result)
result_v_clean <- gsub("<td id=\".*\">|</td>", "", result_v) %>% trimws("left")

# remove first (junk tag)
result_v_clean <- result_v_clean[-1]

writeLines(result_v_clean, "quantLOS.txt")

```
